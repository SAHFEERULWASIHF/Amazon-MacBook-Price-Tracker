The MacBook you were waiting for is now on sale.  
When I started this project, the prices were:

- Black and Sky Blue, 512GB hard disk, 24GB RAM - 125k  
- White and Off White, 512GB, 24GB RAM - 135k  
- All colors, 256GB hard disk, 16GB RAM - 84k  

I'm waiting for it to go under 100k to buy. Now it must be under 1 lakh to end up in this mail.  
Go buy this!  

The link I used for web scraping must still work. Try the link:  

current price: 
Happy purchase!
